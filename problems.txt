1. need to update the snake when moving inside the bot calculations
2. need to calculate if it will be trapped once the apple has been eaten
3. make user experience more nicer





problems to fix at a later date:
- apple spawning randomly. issue is that hypothetically, the snake covers
    the entire map. the probability of the apple spawning at a non snake square is very low








lets start of with how to know if the snake will be trapped
how do you know you're trapped
    1. you are surrounded
        - you check all the way left, right, up and down and u square the smallest distance to the direction of the edge
    2. the area you are surrounded by is less than the length of the snake



very advanced problem:
    - what if the apple spawns at a position where the snake cant reach it in the later iterations


the algorithm is fucked now
    - i think its when it is trapped
    - also miscalculates the tail


resolved:
    - how do you update the snake
        use 2 queues
